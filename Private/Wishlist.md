
Wishlist for FastPHP
--------------------

1. Code folding
=> I need a highlighter that is a subclass of TSynCustomCodeFoldingHighlighter

2. Regions like C# or Delphi (with folding)
=> We would need to "invent" a notation for regions which doesn't break PHP syntax obviously
maybe as simple as:

	    <?php
	    #region "test"
	    ...
	    #endregion
	    ?>

3. Code completion

4. See the method arguments while you are typing a method

5. Gutter: Select single line with a single click at the gutter
=> Works with Lazarus, but not with Delphi!

6. Files in tabs?

7. More intelligent find of the correct method/function/symbol when you press F1

8. When dark theme is enabled, the left top pixel cannot be used to open the window menu (close by double click). This is extremely annoying if you are used to close maximized windows this way.
